# Level 2 (220/240V) Charging
  * Instead of relying on the Level 1 (120V) cord that comes with their Bolt (adds about 4 miles of range per hour), many drivers choose to install Level 2 (240V) charging equipment at home.
  * Depending on the equipment they install, Bolt drivers can expect around 25 miles of range per hour charged using Level 2 charging
